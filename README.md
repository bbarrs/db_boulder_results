## COSC 61: Database Systems Final Project

This repo is used for a project in COSC 61: Database Systems that creates a database based on IFSC Sport Climbing Competition Results.

Thanks to Brett Kurzawa for providing the [kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brkurzawa/ifsc-sport-climbing-competition-results).

Using the database, we developed a front-end client that allows users to interact with the data in a "search by" leaderboard with statistics and different search functionalities.
