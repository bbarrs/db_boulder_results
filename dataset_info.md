# Dataset Info: IFSC Sport Climbing Competition Results

The dataset can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/brkurzawa/ifsc-sport-climbing-competition-results).

We are using a dataset from IFSC Sport Climbing Competitions that focuses on bouldering competitions. 
The dataset includes the following columns: Competition Title,	Competition Date,	First name,	Last name, Nation,
Start Number,	Rank, Qualification, Qualification 1, Qualification 2. Semifinal, Final, Category. 

We will decompose the dataset into a database to answer a number of questions.

**Initial Questions:**
1. Is there a home-field advantage: Are climbers more successful in competitions in their home country?
2. What is the correlation between start number and success in the competition?
3. Who are the winningest climbers in terms of finals appearances and ranks?
4. What competitions have the most successful tops? How does the difficulty of the competition affect the success of highly-ranked climbers?
